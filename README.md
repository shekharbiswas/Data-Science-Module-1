# Module 1 : Python & Statistics

Welcome to the Module 1 which focuses on Python and Statistics core concepts.


In this Module, you would learn basic Python & Statistics along with solving assignments at regular interval. I will guide you through out the module and help you as you progress.

As you know, it is very important to learn 'how to google'. As we all know, we can not improve if we can not measure. Therefore, you can consider the amount of time to find solution on google as the right parameter for measurement. So, as you grow, you should improve on it.

The key lies in the fact that you have to spend time on getting habituated with the keywords that helped you fetch the answer. Once, you know this secret of using proper keyword, you can improve your productivity drastically.

Also, as you book calendly with your mentor, you are supposed to mention the topic of discussion in a detailed manner. Many time it has been found, once you know your problem, you know your solution too. At the same time, your mentor will ask you what are the things that you have tried before asking for help. Therefore, it is advised to keep all the log files (screenshots of error message etc.) ready when you book an appointment.
